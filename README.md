# Parkspot Pi-client
Hi and welcome to the pi-client for the Parkspot parking spot detection.

## For contributors
There is already an pi-client archived that you can access in the parkspot_pi-client_old repository. The reason we don't use it anymore is that setting it up is a little complicated for inexperienced users but feel free to look it up for inspiration. 
The goal has to be to build a product that can be set up by users with basic technical understanding without the need to use a lot of third party guides etc. to get it done. 

## Regarding detection
If there is no modell provided to you and there are too few developers there is a modell in the old archived version that is working, although not nearly as good as needed. However you can use it to implement the detection.
